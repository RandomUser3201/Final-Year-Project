# Heart Rate-Driven Gameplay in a 3D Stealth Game: Exploring Dynamic Difficulty Mechanisms

The artefact is a stealth-based 3D game that challenges player to navigate to the goal while avoiding the Enemy. The Enemy AI uses sound-based mechanics, enabling it to hear, patrol, and chase the player based on auditory cues and heart rate value.

## Summary:

Due to a combination of overestimating my abilities, underestimating the complexity of certain tasks and inadequate project management, I was unable to implement all the planned features within the given timeframe. These features relate to multiple NPCs, player animations and assets, and better camera control. However, managing 

### Implemented:
- A Pathfinding*: Ensures efficient and dynamic movement for NPCs.
- Sound Mechanics: Sound plays a key role in triggering guard actions.
- Dynamic AI: Guards with intelligent behaviour to Chase, Patrol, Attack and detect sound.
- Stealth Mechanic: Using the left shift key to sneak, the player can navigate around the enemy.

To play the game open the "bin" folder and open the .exe". 

### Controls:
- W, A, S, D -> Basic Movement 
- C -> Sneak (Decreases Volume)
- Space -> Display Information

### Gameplay

- The Player must avoid the Enemy and reach the goalPoint position before the timer reaches 0. 
- Sneaking will provide benefit by reducing the volume if within the sound range, or keep it at 0 if pressed before moving. However, it will reduce the Player's speed by 3.
- If the Player is within the sound range and the volume exceeds the detectionthreshold of 0.7, the Enemy will begin chasing.

- The goalPoint position is located at the gate opposite the starting point, behind the green cube.

- Enemy will return to Patrol if the Player is not detected by sight or sound.
- The Player health is set to 3, when the Player is within the attack range the Enemy will reduce the Player's health by 1.
- Use the Space key to assist you with key information.

## Development Log

### October: Initial Setup and Foundations
The project began with importing the necessary assets and setting up the Unity environment. A basic scene prototype was created to test player movement mechanics, which were successfully implemented. Early attempts at implementing A* pathfinding were made, laying the groundwork for future AI game development. While progress was lacking, the focus was on establishing a solid foundation for the game.

### November: Basic Pathfinding and Urgency for AI States
This month saw the successful implementation of basic pathfinding for the enemy AI. Despite taking longer than expected, the system now enables the enemy to track the player's location and avoid obstacles effectively. However, it was clear that enhancements were needed, including path visualization and improving the map for better AI interaction. There was an increasing urgency to implement enemy states, which became the next priority. Overall, the focus shifted toward refining core AI functionality to make the gameplay dynamic and interactive.

### December: Recovery, Enhancements, and Core Features
December was a highly productive but challenging month. After losing previous work due to issues with the package manager and forced pushes, efforts were directed at rebuilding the map and recovering lost code. Enemy patrol logic was introduced, allowing enemies to move within a radius, locate points randomly, and transition into a chase state upon spotting the player.

Enhancements included adding gizmos for debugging, improving obstacle avoidance, and refining A* pathfinding to activate only when the player was in sight. This made enemy behavior more realistic and efficient. Audio detection and player sound mechanics were also integrated: footsteps sounds were added for the player, and sneaking (using the L-Shift key) reduced noise and player speed.

Code quality was a focus this month. A superlinter workflow was set up to identify and fix whitespace errors, and detailed code comments were added for clarity. Additional improvements included fixing a bug that broke all enemy states, reworking enemy AI states, and adding an end-game timer. The game now supports a cohesive enemy state system, consisting of patrol, chase, and attack behaviors based on player noise and visibility. These changes brought the project much closer to its intended vision, setting up a strong foundation for further enhancements.

### January: Enemy AI Overhaul, Stealth Mechanics & Game Polish
January focused on refining enemy AI and implementing sound-based detection. Enemies now respond to player-generated noise, with louder movement triggering a chase. Players can sneak (L-Shift) or stay still to avoid detection.
AI states were reworked into Patrol, Chase, and Attack, based on sight and sound. Key bugs related to LayerMasks and A* Pathfinding were fixed, ensuring stable enemy behavior.
Gameplay was polished with a win condition (reaching the finish before time runs out), improved camera movement, and a GUI update with control instructions. Code was also cleaned and commented for clarity.

### February: Heart Rate Integration, Visibility Toggle & Difficulty Mechanics

During this month the Pulse Rate Manager and Arduino integration to track heart rate were introduced. The goal was to toggle visibility based on heart rate, but this feature is still in progress.
Detection radius was successfully adjusted according to the player's heart rate, allowing the enemy to react more dynamically. A bug in script referencing was fixed, taking 3 hours but resolving the issue.
A fog effect was added, along with a difficulty mechanic: if the playerâ€™s heart rate exceeds 120 for more than 6 seconds, enemy speed increases to 100 (temporarily).

### March: Heart Rate Zones, Accuracy Improvements & Performance Enhancements
This month the focus was on refining the integration of heart rate data with the gameplay and optimizing performance. 
The Arduino project was successfully added to the Unity project folder, consolidating everything in one place for easier management.
To improve performance, heart rate updates were modified from registering every second to a longer interval, addressing earlier performance issues and reducing lag.

A key feature this month was the implementation of a GUI dropdown menu, allowing players to select their age group. Based on the selected group, the game dynamically adjusts the heart rate zones through a dictionary, modifying gameplay mechanics accordingly.

Accuracy improvements were made by adding timers and adjusting the heart rate threshold for more precise detection. This change ensures smoother and more accurate transitions between states.
Additionally, heart rate logs are now generated in a .CSV format, providing a detailed log with each entry containing Timestamp, HeartRate, and EnemyState. The logs can be found in AppData/LocalRow/.

### April: Enhanced Player Controls, Fear Factor & FMOD Integration
The focus this month was on improving player experience and enhancing the horror elements of the game. The player capsule was replaced with a more refined model to provide better controls, offering a smoother and more responsive gameplay experience.
The enemy character was also replaced with a scarier model, accompanied by animations that enhance the fear factor. These animations are still a work in progress but are already contributing to a more immersive atmosphere.

Key technical improvements were made, including fixing the enemy rotation to properly face both the WalkPoint and the player, ensuring better AI behavior.
To deepen the horror experience, lighting was introduced with two spotlights:
A forward-facing flashlight that follows the player, enhancing visibility.
A spotlight above the player, aiding navigation in dark areas.

In terms of audio, FMOD integration was implemented for added realism, introducing an enemy growl and a player heartbeat sound effect to amplify tension. Additionally, issues with player volume and enemy sound range were fixed, improving sound accuracy.

Code cleanup was performed, with efforts to adhere to Unity C# conventions and resolve the issue where PlayerSound.cs would uncheck itself upon play.

Lastly, adjustments were made to the pulse rate logic, filtering out inaccurate data (like a heart rate of 0 or values outside the expected age group zones), ensuring the heart rate system functions correctly.
